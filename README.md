# OSM2WorldWebGLPrototype 
A prototype for the WebGL frontend of OSM2World.

Current Version 0.2
====================

Version 0.2
------------
* The browser now loads the .obj and the associated .mtl file together.
* Ability to Pan/Drag/Zoom added.
* Fixed background color.

Version 0.1
------------
* The code currently just establishes a 3D framework wherein .obj files can be loaded. 
* Texture support is currently missing. Due to the default color of the maps created by OSM2World being dark blue, visibility is very poor, texture support would be implemented in the next update.
* Prototype prompts for 0 map version, 1 for model version.
